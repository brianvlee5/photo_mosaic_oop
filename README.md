## How to use
(I initialized the big picture and the directories for finding small pics, but the image-folder is too big so you might need to have the file on your computer)
1. enter "make install" to install the third party libraries
2. enter "make" to compile
3. enter "./Image_Processing"
4. follow the instructions that appear on the screen
